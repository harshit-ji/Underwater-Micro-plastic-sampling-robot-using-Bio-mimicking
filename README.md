# Underwater-Micro-plastic-sampling-robot-using-Bio-mimicking
It was a mandatory project under our instrumentation and control systems course which is taught in 6th semester of our mechanical engineering program under Prof. I A Palani. We had to make a team and propose a project idea to the professor which he then approves or reject. Our project was about microplastic smapling from underwater ensuring minimal disturbance to the surroundings. Our project was approved and we were allocated a budget of 5000 rupees. We chose the design of a stingray as our robot because we wanted a propulsion mechanism which doesn't use a propeller as it creates a lot of turbulence and hence disturbance hindering our sampling excercise. Prof. Palani suggested us to file a patent for this project which is now underway.
